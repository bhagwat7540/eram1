          Facilitating the deployment of investment capital across sectors,

        <p>
          At Eram Capital, we believe in the growing magnitude of investment
          capital and the sophistication of risk allocation by global
          institutional and family-office investors. Eram strives to facilitate
          the deployment of this intelligent capital to unique investment
          opportunities at the company, asset or project level in high-growth
          markets and sectors in diverse geographies globally. We provide
          innovative and flexible investment structures that include special
          purpose entities, managed accounts, securitization products, and
          typical fund structures. Eram has focused its human capital and
          financial resources on sectors it forecasts are being increasingly
          driven by pertinent, long-term, global demographic growth factors.
          Energy consumption, population growth, urbanization, food consumption
          and globalization, are some of the key factors driving our investment
          focus in our core sectors.
